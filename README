RangeQuery version 0.04
=======================

=head1 NAME

RangeQuery - retrieves the minimum/maximum value from a sequence within a given range.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RangeQuery;

    my @sequence = (4,2,-8,6,-1,2);
    my $range = RangeQuery->new(@sequence);
    my $min = $range->min_value(0,2);   # -8
    my $max = $range->max_value (3, 5); # 6


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Retrieves the minimum/maximum value in a given range. 
It takes O(n log n) to build the RangeQuery object and O(1) to retrieve a value.

Note: You should use a more naive approach with small sequences of values.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new RangeQuery object.
This builds the appropriate data structure in order to retrieve values efficiently.

=cut

=head2 max_value

Retrieves the maximum value in a given range.

=cut

=head2 min_value

Retrieves the minimum value in a given range.
